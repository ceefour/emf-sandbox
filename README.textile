1. *xml-ecoreonly*: Mapping from Ecore to XML (XSD) and back. You can export the Ecore+genmodel to XSD.
   And edit the XML using an XML Schema-aware editor.
   An XML file can be read and written using EMF with just loading the EPackage from the @.ecore@ file,
   not needing the generated EPackage Java classes.
